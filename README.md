# TIC-TAC-TOE
Develop an interactive frontend for a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players will take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their 'X' or 'O'. The interface should clearly display the board, indicate whose turn it is, and announce the winner or a draw. The project focuses on HTML structure, CSS styling for visual appeal, and JavaScript logic for game state management and user interaction
